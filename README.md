# Node.js Demo Project

This project is a simple demo application developed with Node.js. While creating this project, I learned and implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The application is developed with the Express.js framework and data management is done using the file system.

## About Project

This project was developed to learn and implement MVC architecture using Node.js and Express.js. Within the scope of the project, data is stored in the file system and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be performed on this data.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The project uses the MVC pattern to separate business logic, data management, and user interface.
- **Built with Express.js**: The project is developed using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js.
- **File System Integration**: Data is stored and managed as JSON files in the file system.
